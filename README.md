## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end Tableau dashboard development workflow**, inspired by the tutorial created by **[Data with Baraa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dahrmqT5GD4)**.  
The objective was to take raw data, clean and transform it, and design a professional interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights for business decision-making.

The dataset used is a variation of the **Sample Superstore dataset**, which contains details about orders, customers, regions, categories, and financial metrics like Sales and Profit.

## ❓ Questions I Wanted to Answer
- What are the **overall sales and profit trends** over time?
- Which **categories and subcategories** generate the most revenue and profit?
- How do **different regions** perform in terms of sales and profit?
- Are there any **patterns in customer purchases or shipping modes**?
- Which products are **underperforming or resulting in losses**?

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public** – for building the dashboard.
- **Microsoft Excel** – for initial data cleaning and preparation.
- **GitHub** – for version control and sharing the project.
- **YouTube (Data with Baraa)** – for learning best practices and dashboard design.

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Cleanup
- Standardized **date formats** for `Order Date` and `Ship Date`.
- Verified data types and ensured all columns were properly categorized.

## 🔍 Analysis & Dashboard Design
The dashboard was structured into three key sections:
1. **KPI Section:**  
   - Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Quantity, Total Customers, Total Sales Per Customer, Total Orders.
2. **Trend Analysis:**  
   - **Line chart** showing sales over time.
   - **Year filter** for comparison.
3. **Category & Regional Breakdown:**  
   - **Bar chart** for sales by category.
   - Filters for **Region**, **Category**, and **Ship Mode**.

**Interactive Features:**
- **Dynamic filters** for drilling down.
- **Hover tooltips** for additional metrics.
- **Highlight actions** for visual emphasis.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project was an excellent opportunity to practice end-to-end business intelligence development using Tableau. I gained hands-on experience in:

- Data preparation and cleaning – ensuring the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis.

- Analytical thinking – identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) and deciding what insights would bring the most value to stakeholders.

- Visualization best practices – designing a dashboard that is not only visually appealing but also highly interactive and intuitive.

- Storytelling with data – presenting findings in a way that helps decision-makers take action.

By completing this project, I learned how to structure dashboards for clarity, use filters and parameters for interactivity, and apply visual hierarchy to highlight the most important insights. This process mimics real-world business scenarios where data-driven decisions are critical.

Overall, this project strengthened my ability to work with Tableau as a data visualization tool, while also improving my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and understanding of business metrics.
I am confident that these skills can be applied to real business problems to deliver data solutions that drive results.
